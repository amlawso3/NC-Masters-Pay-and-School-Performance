# NC-Masters-Pay-and-School-Performance
Project Plan:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationship between teacher masters degrees and 
school performance (as measured by School Performance Scores).
The initial project with NC DPI was intended to examine evidence for reinstating masters pay.
The analysis plan is to examine 2017 data so I can compare my prior work with my revised work.
      
Key Background:
    - NC provides each school with a School Performance Score, which is then categorized in to School 
      Performance Grades (A-F). This has been controversial due to research showing this highly correlated
      with poverty.
    - NC removed additional pay for teachers who obtained a Masters degree in 2013. This impacted the number
      of teachers obtaining a masters degree. Research is mixed on the impact of Masters degrees on
      student learning.
    
Key Terms:
    - LEA = Local Education Agency
    - SEA = State Education Agency
    - SPG = School Performance Grades (categorization of the School Performance Scores)
    - CEP = Community Eligible Provision (aka the Free and Reduced Lunch Program)
    - 1-1 = One to One program to provide 1 device to each student
    - EE  = Educator Effectiveness (Calculated by SAS to estimate how much students "should have" grown with 
                                    a teacher. Generally categorized into meets, exceeds, or does not meet growth.
                                    If a grade or course has no state assessment, the principal rates may be used.)
    - Supplement = The state provides a base salary for teachers and LEAs can provide supplements to increase
                   the pay for the teachers in their schools. Supplement amounts vary greatly throughout the state.
